# Smart Check 🛡️

**AI-powered Smart Contract Auditor** using the **Gemini Foundation Model**

Smart Check is an AI-driven platform designed to **analyze and audit smart contracts** written in **Solidity, Golang, Python, and JavaScript**. It leverages the **Gemini Foundation Model** to detect vulnerabilities, suggest optimizations, and improve the overall security of decentralized applications (dApps).

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Choose the contract language (Solidity / Golang / Python / JavaScript).
2. Upload or paste your smart contract code.
3. Smart Check sends the contract to the **Gemini Foundation Model**.
4. The model analyzes the code for vulnerabilities, optimizations, and best practices.
5. A detailed audit report is generated for the user.
